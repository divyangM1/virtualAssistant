# Virtual Assistant

Virtual Assistant is a Python-based voice-controlled assistant designed to perform various tasks using speech recognition and text-to-speech modules. Currently, it can process human voice commands and provide the current time.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition:** Virtual Assistant can understand voice commands, making it a hands-free way to interact with your computer.

- **Time Reporting:** Ask Virtual Assistant for the current time, and it will provide you with the accurate time.

- **Upcoming Features:** We have plans to enhance Virtual Assistant with the following features:
  - **Stock Portfolio:** Get updates on your stock portfolio by simply asking.
  - **Scheduling:** Let Virtual Assistant manage your schedules and appointments.
  - **Facebook Integration:** After merging the MessageFb code (uploaded in GitHub), it will have the capability to send messages to people on Facebook.
